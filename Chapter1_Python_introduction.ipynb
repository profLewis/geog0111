For scientific computing, a large number of useful add-ons (\"libraries\") are available to help you analyse and process data. This is an invaluable resource.\n",

    "In a more general sense, we can take a 'slice' of an array, with the syntax `[start:stop:skip]` giving access to a regularly spaced part of an array. We can use this, for example, to print out every 10th value (`skip=10`).\n",

We saw dictionaries as collections with which we refer to individual items with a key.\n",

We saw how we can use `zip()` to help load a dataset from arrays into a dictionary, and also the value of using a dictionary representation when saving numpy files."
