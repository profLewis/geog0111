    "[GDAL](https://gdal.org) is the workhorse of geospatial processing. Basically, GDAL offers a common library to access a vast number of formats (if you want to see how vast, [check this](https://gdal.org/formats_list.html)). In addition to letting you open and convert obscure formats to something more useful, a lot of functionality in terms of processing raster data is available (for example, working with projections, combining datasets, accessing remote datasets, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "For vector data, the counterpart to GDAL is OGR (which is now a part of the GDAL library anyway), which also supports [many vector formats](https://gdal.org/ogr_formats.html). The combination of both libraries is a very powerful tool to work with geospatial data, not only from Python, but from [many other popular computer languages](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/#GDALOGRInOtherLanguages).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will introduce the `gdal` geospatial module which can read a wide range of raster scientific data formats. We will also introduce the related `ogr` vector package.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pacticular, we will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* access and download NASA geophysical datasets (specifically, the MODIS LAI/FPAR product)\n",
    "* apply a vector mask to the dataset\n",
    "* apply quality control flags to the data\n",
    "* stack datasets into a 3D numpy dataset for further analysis, including interpolation of missing values\n",
    "* visualise the data\n",
    "* store the stacked dataset\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    LAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies. FPAR is the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) absorbed by green vegetation. Both variables are used for calculating surface photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and net primary production, which in turn are used to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation. Algorithm refinements have improved quality of retrievals and consistency with field measurements over all biomes, with a focus on woody vegetation.\n",
